Create Lao PDF to Word Converter

Objective:

Create a web application that uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) libraries that support the Lao language to convert PDF files to fully editable Word documents. The converted documents should be compatible with Microsoft Word and can be viewed and downloaded by users.

Requirements:

The web app should accept PDF files as input and output fully editable Word documents (.docx).
The OCR library used should be able to recognize Lao text and convert it to editable text.
The web app should be able to process multiple PDF files at once.
The converted Word documents should be compatible with Microsoft Word and can be viewed and edited using Microsoft Word.
The web app should allow users to download the converted Word documents in .docx format.
The web app should have a user-friendly interface that allows users to select the input PDF file, select the output format (Word document), and view the conversion results.
The web app should handle errors and exceptions properly, such as invalid input PDF files or OCR errors.
Technical Requirements:

Programming languages: Python, JavaScript, or any other suitable programming language.
OCR libraries: Tesseract-OCR, GOCR, or any other OCR library that supports Lao language.
Web framework: Flask, Django, or any other suitable web framework.
Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any other suitable database management system.
Operating System: Windows, Linux, or macOS.
Deliverables:

A fully functional web app that can convert PDF files to fully editable Word documents using OCR libraries that support Lao language.
A user-friendly interface that allows users to select the input PDF file, select the output format (Word document), and view the conversion results.
A comprehensive documentation of the project, including code snippets, installation instructions, and troubleshooting guides.
Evaluation Criteria:

Functionality: Does the web app successfully convert PDF files to fully editable Word documents using OCR libraries that support Lao language?
User Interface: Is the user interface intuitive and easy to use?
Performance: Does the web app handle multiple PDF files at once efficiently?
Compatibility: Are the converted Word documents compatible with Microsoft Word?
Error Handling: Does the web app handle errors and exceptions properly?
